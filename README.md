## ideas
Firstly use the decision tree to classify the game. 0 stands for that the kid don't play it at all. 1 stands for like and 2 stands for like very much.
Then do polynomial regression in 1 and 2 class independently.
## reproduction
The code corresponding to the best result has been added. While I forgot to set the random seed during using train_test_split() to produce
train and test data. So Everytime you run it, the result will be different. So it might not be reproduced, but all the outputs have been recorded in this jupyter notebook.
